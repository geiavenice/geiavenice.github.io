		<p>The Anderson Program puts students, families, and their college coach on the same team. Over eighteen months we work 1-on-1 with you to come up with a list of 10 competitive schools (4 "reach" schools, 4 "middle" schools, and 2 "safety" schools). Then, using the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy's</a> fantastic online platform and our own innovative curriculum, we help you take the steps necessary to be admitted. We stand by our model by guaranteeing that you will be admitted to one of their schools, otherwise you receive a full refund. We're sure that together we can take care of business. It's that simple.</p> 

		<p>Almost every school receives enough applications to fill its freshman class many times over so cannot guarantee admission into a particular school. More importantly, guaranteeing admission to a particular school is both irresponsible and unethical.</p></div></div>

		<div class="program">
		<div class="programelements1"><h3>Guarantee</h3>
		<p> With practice and a good coach anything is possible. GuidEd is able to guarantee admissions to college because we trust our model. We speak with you each month over an eighteen month period to get to know your strengths, weaknesses, and personality. In a candid, 1-on-1 environment we help you understand where you stand in the college admissions process and we recommend ways in which you can change your trajectory. Rather than cramming college counseling into a few hours or days, we ensure that you stay mindful of your academic goals by practicing practical exercises online each week. Then we give you all the support you need to confidently tackle your essays, applications and interviews. As long as you attend 90% of your monthly sessions and avoid serious disciplinary trouble we're sure you'll do well.</p>

		<p>Does guaranteed college admission sound too good to be true? Only if you haven't practiced enough. </p>

		<div class="programelements"><h3>Curriculum</h3>
		<p> Guided Education's curriculum is meant to supplement what students typically learn in high school. Our coaches assign practice problems using the Khan Academy's award-winning online educational library. This offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empowers learners to study at their own pace. Students have access to resources on virtually any academic subject. Simultaneously, detailed results of this practice are sent to the coach in real-time, who can then provide extra instruction or more challenging work! This automatic oversight adds a very important element of student responsibility to the Anderson program.</p> 

		<p>In addition to practice problems, students practice their writing every week. We curate collection of riveting multi-media outlets to create essay prompts that push students to thoughtfully consider their views on culture, business, technology, politics, and entertainment. Every assignment is reviewed by their coach who will not only review the grammar and punctuation, but more importantly will engage the student in a thoughtful conversation over these issues. This process challenges students to think carefully about unfamiliar issues.</p>

		<div class="programelements"><h3>Coaches</h3>
		<p> Our coaches are the backbone of what GuidED is. All of our coaches have degrees from top-tier universities, but what sets them apart is their passion for working directly with students. The national average number of students per guidance counselor is over 475 to 1, but Guided Education coaches are limited to 80 students so they can spend enough time crafting and executing a plan for each student. Coaches are part instructor and part mentor. They will offer extra academic instruction, review essays, conduct mock interviews, and much more while getting to know them and sharing their own wisdom.</p> 

		<p>Coaches also ensure that parents are engaged during the college application process. Coaches meet with parents every quarter over video chat to make sure you know exactly what you should be doing each step of the way (they can also readily provide a status update at any time, just send them an email). All video chat sessions are recorded, archived, and retained.</p>
