		<p>Guided Education is a national private college counseling company designed to connect students with college coaches via video chat and email. Our mission is to help students understand why they want to go to college and what they need to do to get there. There is significant evidence that families are not getting the type of guidance they need. For example, according to a 2009 survey by the U.S. Department of Education, the average public school student receives a total of 38 minutes of college admissions advice before graduating.  We believe that this is one of the biggest factors creating anxiety and underperformance in Americaâ€™s high school students. </p>

		<p>At GuidEd, we recognize that many students feel overwhelmed with the college admissions process. We know that young people need support in order to make sound life decisions. Without effective guidance, many grow overwhelmed and disaffected over time. However, we know that, at their core, every individual wants to be productive. We aim to unlock this desire by providing our young people with the mentorship and advice they need to make sound life decisions. We work with students and their parents over eighteen months to build a sense of confidence that is grounded in knowledge and understanding of what lies ahead. </p>

		<p>With GuidEd, students spend over twenty five times more 1-on-1 time with a college coach than the national average. Using a unique curriculum built around academics, current events, and technology, we will work tirelessly to tear down every myth, bad habit, prejudice, bias, and "little white lie" that creates doubt in our young people. We believe that learning can encourage a sense of self-confidence that emboldens students to express their unique, innate desire for personal growth. We will work with students individually to provide information, context, leadership (by example), and a large dose of reality. We are profoundly excited to see what they do with our future. </p></div>
