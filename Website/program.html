		<p>The Anderson Program puts students, families, and their college coach on the same team. Over eighteen months we work 1-on-1 with you to come up with a list of 10 competitive schools (4 "reach" schools, 4 "match" schools, and 2 "safety" schools). Then, with the use of an innovative online curriculum, we help you take the steps necessary to be admitted. We stand by our model by guaranteeing that you will be admitted to one of these schools, otherwise you receive a full refund. Together we can take care of business. It's that simple.</p>
		<p> GuidEd is not endorsed or associated with any college, university, or any other institution of higher learning. Further, we cannot guarantee admission into any particular school because it is both irresponsible and unethical. However, if you do the work, you&rsquo;ll get the results.</p>

		<p>Families who sign up before July ends save 50% for the duration of the program. Spots are limited, so apply today!</p></div></div>

		<div class="programelements"><img id="graphic1" src="images/coachesgraphic.png"><h3>The Coaches</h3>
		<p> Our coaches are the backbone of Guided Education. What sets them apart is their passion for working directly with you, the student. The national average number of students per guidance counselor is over 475 to 1, but GuidEd coaches are limited to 100 students so they can devote the time necessary to craft and execute a unique plan for each student. </p>

		<p>Coaches are part instructor and part mentor. They will offer extra academic instruction, review essays, conduct mock interviews, and much more while getting to know you and sharing their own wisdom.</p>

		<p> Coaches also ensure that parents are engaged during the college application process. Coaches meet with your parents every quarter over video chat for transparency and to ensure that they provide you the encouragement necessary at home. (Coaches can and will also readily provide a status update via email whenever necessary). All video chat sessions are recorded, archived, and retained and can be promptly reviewed upon request.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="programelements"><img id="graphic1" src="images/curriculumgraphic.png"><h3>The Curriculum</h3>
		<p> Guided Education's curriculum is meant to supplement what students typically learn in high school. Students practice their writing every week. We curate a collection of engaging content and create essay prompts that encourage students to thoughtfully consider their views on culture, business, technology, politics, and entertainment. Every assignment is reviewed by their coach who will not only review the grammar and punctuation, but will further engage the student in an introspective conversation over these issues. This process challenges students to think carefully about unfamiliar issues. </p>
		<p>In addition, our coaches assign practice problems using the Khan Academy's award-winning online educational library. KA offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empowers learners to study at their own pace. Coaches can help students close gaps in their knowledge or assign higher level work for those who need a challenge. KA then sends detailed results of these weekly practices to the coach; this exchange creates a strong element of responsibility among Anderson Program scholars. </p>

		<div class="programelements"><img id="graphic1" src="images/guaranteegraphic.png"><h3>The Guarantee</h3>
		<p> GuidEd is able to guarantee admissions to a four-year college because we trust our model. With practice and a good coach, anything is possible. We speak with you each month over an eighteen month period to get to know your strengths, weaknesses, and personality. In a candid, 1-on-1 environment we can help you understand where you stand in the college admissions process, and we will recommend ways in which you can change your trajectory.</p>

		<p>Instead of cramming college counseling into a few hours or days, we ensure that you stay mindful of your academic goals by solving practical exercises online each week. Then, we give you all the support you need to confidently tackle your essays, applications, and interviews. As long as you attend your monthly sessions and avoid serious disciplinary trouble, we guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be accepted into one of the competitive schools on your list. </p> 

		<p>Does guaranteed college admission sound too good to be true? Only if you haven't practiced enough.</p>
