		The GuidEd team is filled with engaging personalities who each bring a unique, global perspective to the educational problems we are facing today. With over a decade of experience working with high school students and enthusiasm to spare, we will work tirelessly to tear down every myth, bad habit, prejudice, bias, and "little white lie" that creates doubt in our young people.</div></div>

		<div class="teambio"><img class="teampic" src="images/jose.jpg"><h3>Jose Hernandez</h3><p class="jobtitle">Founder & CEO</p>
		<p> Prior to graduating from Brown University, CEO Jose Hernandez attended Perth Amboy High School in one of New Jersey&rsquo;s poorest school districts. In the 1985 ruling in the case of Abbott vs. Burke it was decided that education in Perth Amboy was unconstitutionally substandard, and as a result the state began providing significant financial assistance to make up the difference. While the achievement gap narrowed after the decision, the gains eventually plateaued. This experience proved the limits to which dollars can solve a social problem. Jose firmly believes that without greater compassion, accountability, and especially guidance, there will always be a persistent gap between what students can achieve and the results they actually produce. He founded Guided Education expressly to minimize this gap.

		<div class="teambio"><img class="teampic" src="images/geia.jpg"><h3>Geia Reyes</h3><p class="jobtitle">Chief Marketing Officer</p>
		<p> CMO Geia Reyes comes to the GuidEd team with an extensive background in National Broadcast Media. She overcame the odds as a student in the inner-city school district of Perth Amboy, NJ, to graduate from Barnard College of Columbia University. Having first-hand knowledge of both the difficult educational reality of under-resourced communities and the transformative power of a supportive college, Geia brings an unstoppable passion to the team. She is passionate about empowering our young people and ensuring they, too, take advantage of the educational tools that have guided her perspective. Most recently, Geia returned from international volunteer work in East Africa, where she traveled to Tanzania and devoted her time leading grassroots efforts, teaching kids English and Music daily, and developing an orphanage and the surrounding community. </p>
