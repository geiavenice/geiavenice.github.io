		<div class="teambio"><img class="teampic" src="images/jose.jpg"><h3>Jose Hernandez</h3><p class="jobtitle">Founder & CEO</p>
		<p> CEO Jose Hernandez graduated from Brown University with a concentration in Economics and Education. Upon graduation, he climbed the ranks at Morgan Stanley, managing risk in their Institutional Equities Division. However, for over a decade, his passion has been mentoring young people. During college he was an adjunct faculty member at the prestigious Wheeler School, and since graduation he has volunteered as an SAT Coach with an inner-city non-profit organization, Let’s Get Ready!</p>
		<p>Prior to college, he attended Perth Amboy High School in one of New Jersey’s poorest school districts. In the 1985 ruling in the case of Abbott vs. Burke it was decided that education in Perth Amboy was unconstitutionally substandard, and as a result the state began providing additional financial assistance to make up the difference. While the achievement gap narrowed after the decision, the gains eventually plateaued. This experience proved the limits to which dollars can solve a social problem. Jose firmly believes that without greater compassion, responsibility, and guidance, there will always be a persistent gap between what students can achieve and the results they actually produce. He founded Guided Education expressly to minimize this gap. </p>

		<div class="teambio"><img class="teampic" src="images/geia.jpg"><h3>Geia Reyes</h3><p class="jobtitle">Chief Marketing Officer</p>
		<p> CMO Geia Reyes possesses an extensive professional background in National Broadcast Media, gaining experience at two of the leading global advertising agencies in the world after graduating from Columbia University. She advanced smoothly through the ranks, becoming a Media Investment Manager on the award-winning Volkswagen of America team at MediaCom USA. Most recently, Geia returned from international volunteer work in East Africa. She traveled to Arusha, Tanzania and devoted her time leading grassroots efforts, teaching kids English and Music daily while developing an orphanage and the surrounding community.</p>
		<p>As a student in the inner-city school district of Perth Amboy, NJ, Geia witnessed first-hand the difficulty of educational development, both individually and as a member of her minority-dominated community. Overcoming the odds, she graduated from Barnard College in 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and concentration in Psychology. Demonstrating the importance of a strong college match, Barnard’s college provided Geia a strong passion and voice for women’s empowerment, and endless resources to educational tools that have guided her perspective. Combined with her life-changing experience in Tanzania, she brings a unique blend of passion, creativity, and outstanding communication skills to the GuidEd team.</p>
