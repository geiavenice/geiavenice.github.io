		<p>Guided Education is a national private college counseling company designed to connect students with college coaches via video chat and email. Our mission is to help students understand why they want to go to college and what they need to do to get there. There is significant evidence that families are not getting the type of guidance they need. For example, according to a 2009 survey by the U.S. Department of Education, the average public school student receives a total of 38 minutes of college admissions advice before graduating.  We believe that this is one of the biggest factors creating anxiety and underperformance in Americaâ€™s high school students. </p>

		<p>With GuidEd, students spend over twenty five times more 1-on-1 time with a college coach than the national average. Using a unique curriculum built around academics, current events, and technology, we will work tirelessly to tear down every myth, bad habit, prejudice, bias, and "little white lie" that creates doubt in our young people. We believe that learning can encourage a sense of self-confidence that emboldens students to express their unique, innate desire for personal growth. We will work with students individually to provide information, context, leadership (by example), and a large dose of reality. We are profoundly excited to see what they do with our future. </p></div>
