		<p>Guided Education is a national educational company designed to connect students with college coaches who will help them navigate the college application process via video chat and email. Our mission is to help students understand why they want to go to college and what they need to do to get there.</p> <p>There is significant evidence that families are not getting the type of guidance they need. For example, according to a 2009 survey by the U.S. Department of Education, the average public school student receives a total of 38 minutes of college admissions advice before graduating. We believe that this is one of the biggest factors creating anxiety and underperformance in America&rsquo;s high school students.</p> <p>With GuidEd, students spend over twenty five times more 1-on-1 time with a college coach than the national average. We will work together over your junior and senior year to recommend a list of 10 competitive schools (4 "reach" schools, 4 "match" schools, and 2 "safety" schools) and a reasonable roadmap towards admission. Our long-term approach emboldens students to express their unique, innate desire for personal growth. We will work with students individually to provide information, context, and a large dose of reality. We stand by our model by guaranteeing that you will be admitted to one or more of the schools on your list; otherwise you receive a full refund. </p><p id="talkaboutcollege">Let&rsquo;s talk about college.</p></div>
